# ShokaiShelf
ShokaiShelf is a Anime Organising Software that is capable to search for Animes and create Watch Lists and Buy Lists for DVDs and  BluRays. This is my first Project, so be kind with me :)

Note: Because of an Early Phase, the Raw Program (The Py Files) needs the following Python Add-Ons installed: tkinter, ttkbootstrap, requests. 
You are able to install these with "pip install "Package Name" "
